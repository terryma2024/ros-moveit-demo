# SO-101 Parallel Adaptive Worker Pool Experiment Ledger

```yaml
task_id: so101-adaptive-worker-pool
goal: Implement and qualify the lightweight adaptive worker pool from W8 through W1 for MuJoCo MoveIt expert execute batches.
success_contract: Complete all 13 implementation tasks, automated gates, two live infrastructure fault injections, one 20/20 execute batch, and valid W1/W2/W4/W6/W8 performance samples without changing v1 behavior.
worktree: /data/work/ws_moveit/.worktrees/parallel-adaptive-worker-pool
branch: codex/parallel-adaptive-worker-pool
base_commit: 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab
current_commit: 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab
evidence_root: /data/work/so101-evidence/parallel-adaptive-worker/20260914-a01
confirmed_conclusions:
  - origin/main equals the reviewed baseline 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab; startup preflight CP-001.
  - the legacy worktree remains at 2d13ae65490cf1eccfd57fa683e4b13b41784402 with its untracked admission test preserved; startup preflight CP-001.
  - no SO-101, MoveIt, MuJoCo, Gazebo, or RViz runtime process and no ROS_DOMAIN_ID 0 node was observed before implementation; startup preflight CP-001.
disproven_routes:
  - the superseded heavy AdmissionAuthority/profile/Ed25519/cgroup/canary design is outside this task and will not be reused.
open_hypotheses:
  - the lightweight contracts and factory boundary can extend W1-W8 while preserving frozen v1 W1-W3 behavior and serialized bytes.
  - exact cleanup and persistent Domain markers are sufficient for safe fallback without broad process discovery.

## Evidence policy

- Registered evidence root: `/data/work/so101-evidence/parallel-adaptive-worker/20260914-a01`.
- Every ai-station pytest or colcon invocation uses a unique, previously nonexistent directory under `scratch/<test-run-id>/tmp` for `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP`.
- Scratch directories, logs, manifests, screenshots, and runtime evidence are retained unless the user separately authorizes deletion.
- `/data/work/ws_moveit/.worktrees/parallel-w8-admission-v2`, its untracked test, and `/data/work/so101-evidence/parallel-w8/20260913-q01` are read-only preserved external state.

## EXP-001 — Automated adaptive contracts and package integration

```yaml
experiment_id: EXP-001
status: PLANNED
prior_experiment: NONE
hypothesis: The adaptive contracts, scheduler, production adapter, cleanup path, and CLI can satisfy the lightweight design while leaving v1 behavior unchanged.
prediction: Task-level RED tests fail only because each planned interface is absent, then pass after minimal implementation; the final so101_demo_py package gate collects nonzero ordinary tests with zero errors and failures.
single_variable: Introduce only the explicit adaptive-workers path described by the reviewed plan.
lifecycle: ISOLATED_STACK
preconditions:
  - source starts from origin/main commit 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab in the dedicated worktree.
  - no live SO-101 stack is used by this automated experiment.
  - each test command receives a fresh NVMe scratch directory and verified tempfile path.
success_criteria:
  - every planned RED fails at the intended missing behavior boundary.
  - every task GREEN and compatibility regression exits 0.
  - package test collects nonzero tests only under src/so101_demo_py/test and reports zero errors and failures.
failure_criteria:
  - a planned contract remains absent, a compatibility regression appears, or package test reports an error or failure.
invalid_criteria:
  - source, Python, install overlay, or scratch provenance differs from the recorded command.
provenance:
  source_commit: 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab
  install_overlay: /data/work/ws_moveit/.worktrees/parallel-adaptive-worker-pool/install
  runtime_executable: /usr/bin/python3
  ros_domain_id: 0
  gz_partition: adaptive-worker-exp001-contracts
commands:
  - command: per-task pytest RED/GREEN commands and final colcon package gate from the implementation plan
    exit_code: PENDING
observed:
  - Startup preflight is recorded at /data/work/so101-evidence/parallel-adaptive-worker/20260914-a01/preflight/dispatch-preflight.md.
  - Baseline-007 passed all 1111 existing parallel-batch tests in 50.51 s outside the sandbox with current-checkout so101_demo source mapping and existing ai-station ROS/MuJoCo dependency overlay.
inferred:
  - NONE
conclusion: PENDING
evidence:
  - /data/work/so101-evidence/parallel-adaptive-worker/20260914-a01
decision: PENDING

## CP-001 — Dispatch and implementation baseline

```yaml
checkpoint_id: CP-001
last_valid_experiment: NONE
current_hypothesis: The reviewed lightweight design can be implemented from the clean origin/main baseline without using the preserved heavy branch.
working_tree_status: clean at 4c777fa722586be92a0b357b861ab4ce460a06ab before ledger creation
owned_processes: current Codex session only; no SO-101 runtime process started
preserved_processes: tmux sessions codex and codex-task-so101-adaptive-worker-pool; no codex-cua or legacy admission session existed at preflight
confirmed_conclusions:
  - origin/main was fetched from Gitee and equals the required reviewed commit.
  - target worktree and branch were absent before creation, then created at the required path and commit.
  - ROS_DOMAIN_ID 0 had no visible nodes, and no matching SO-101 runtime process was present.
disproven_routes:
  - reuse of the old heavy W8 worktree is prohibited and unnecessary.
open_risks:
  - the root workspace install overlay contains a stale so101_demo_py hook; all build and runtime provenance must use the new worktree overlay.
  - live MuJoCo, Docker broker, model, GPU, and GUI availability remain unverified until later task gates.
  - baseline-001 through baseline-005 are invalid environment probes and their scratch trees are deletion candidates; baseline-007 is the valid subsystem baseline.
next_command: dispatch Task 1 implementer from its generated brief
```
