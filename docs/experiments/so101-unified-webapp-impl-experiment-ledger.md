## CP-01: Registration, host probe and deviations

Worktree `.worktrees/so101-unified-webapp` on branch `codex/so101-unified-webapp` from `main`
5b8d1231. Single evidence root `/tmp/so101-debug-so101-unified-webapp-impl-20260920` registered in
this ledger; no `/data` path applies on this host. Files under `operator/` hold the frozen gate
policy object that Task 0 verifies by SHA256 and hostname.

Preserved processes: tmux sessions `dst`, `dst-so101-macos-mps-w2` (attached), `so101-teleop-w2-e2e`
were observed before work started and were not touched. No ROS graph or service was started,
stopped or inspected for ownership during this checkpoint.

Probed facts: `bun` 1.3.14 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/bun`; `node` v25.9.0; `dst` present at
`/Users/matianyi/.nvm/versions/node/v25.9.0/bin/dst`; ROS 2 Jazzy is a macOS source build rooted at
`/Users/matianyi/ros2_jazzy` with install overlays `extra_ws`, `so101_isolated_ws` and a Python 3.11
venv at `~/ros2_jazzy/.venv`; there is no `/opt/ros/jazzy` and no ai-station shell in this session.

### Deviations from the plan (reported, not silently substituted)

- **D-1 host**: the plan is written for ai-station Linux with a `/data/work/so101-evidence` root and
  NVMe scratch rules. This session runs on macOS, where `AGENTS.md` explicitly exempts the `/data`
  rule. Registered root is therefore the `/tmp` root above; every gate still proves the exact
  interpreter and `tempfile.gettempdir()` inside a per-invocation scratch directory.
- **D-2 test Python**: Task 0 requires proving Python 3.12 before use. No 3.12 interpreter with
  Pydantic 2, FastAPI, pytest, uvicorn and rclpy exists on this host: Homebrew has 3.11 and 3.14,
  `uv` has a bare managed 3.12.13 without those packages, and the plan forbids installing
  dependencies or quietly swapping interpreters. The repository's own macOS test contract
  (`.agents/skills/so101-dev/references/test-and-acceptance.md`) names
  `/Users/matianyi/ros2_jazzy/.venv/bin/python3` as the actual test interpreter, so that verified
  3.11.15 venv (Pydantic 2.13.4, FastAPI 0.115.14, pytest 8.4.2, uvicorn 0.34.3) is registered as
  `TEST_PYTHON`. This is a documented deviation from the plan's version literal, not a silent swap;
  ai-station execution must re-prove 3.12 before any Linux gate is trusted.
- **D-3 Node**: the plan requires Node `>=24.18.1 <25`. This host has only v25.9.0. All frontend
  install/build/test work goes through Bun 1.3.14 per repository rules, so no Node-versioned
  production artifact is produced here; the mismatch is recorded rather than resolved by installing
  a second Node runtime.
- **D-4 worktree creation**: the plan assigns worktree creation to the operator before dispatch. The
  goal for this session explicitly asks for the worktree and branch, so it was created here and
  recorded with branch, base commit and remotes above.

## CP-02: Task 0 - registered execution gate

Delivered `src/so101_teleop/test/e2e/record_gate.py` and `src/so101_teleop/test/test_unified_gate.py`,
registered as `test_unified_gate` in `src/so101_teleop/CMakeLists.txt`.

RED: 2 failed / 17 errors because the helper did not exist (`ModuleNotFoundError`-class collection
errors), exit 1, scratch `/private/tmp/.../scratch-9DGvEZoP/tmp`. GREEN: 19 passed, exit 0.
`pygate` was then validated end-to-end: gate record `gates/b8a2e0c40aa4469a971ac838d05b438f/result.json`
shows `test_python=/Users/matianyi/ros2_jazzy/.venv/bin/python`, `tempfile_dir` inside that run's own
`tmp/`, `exit_code=0`, `elapsed_seconds=1.37`, and the registered policy digest.

The gate refuses an unregistered root, a non-NVMe root when the operator object requires NVMe, host
mismatch, policy hash drift, missing policy fields, missing policy reference, and any interpreter or
TEMP mismatch - and in the mismatch cases it proves the command under test never started.
Commit `d66f9ae4`.

## CP-03: Task 1 - persistent global mutation arbiter

Delivered `unified/{__init__,contracts,intent_store,arbiter}.py` and
`test/teleop/test_unified_arbiter.py`, registered as `test_unified_arbiter`.

RED: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'so101_teleop.unified'`, exit 2. GREEN: 15 passed, exit 0.
Covered: durable reservation across restart with unconverged-intent blocking, command idempotency by
canonical fingerprint with NaN refusal, two-thread admission race admitting exactly one domain, the
second service instance refused by `flock` both in-process and from a second process, cancel between
prepare and ACK still registering the late goal, terminal without cleanup proof staying blocked, and
an existing legacy journal's bytes unchanged.

Deviation: `IntentStore.settle` commits a refusal fence before the arbiter raises, so a blocked parent
can never be rolled back into `active` by the refusal itself. Commit `958bb86c`.

## CP-04: Task 2 - instance proof and lease binding fences

Delivered `unified/instances.py`, instance/authority types in `unified/contracts.py`, and
`test/teleop/test_unified_instances.py`, registered as `test_unified_instances`.

RED: collection error with `instances.py` moved aside, exit 2. GREEN: 12 passed, exit 0. Covered:
copied valid lease cannot control a second document, renew never moves the execution generation,
handoff bumps it once and only when the arbiter is idle, reconnect bumps the channel revision and
rejects the old revision, wrong origin / swapped domain proof / dead channel refused, proofs never
persisted (raw database bytes searched), abandoned-controller recovery requires proof that nothing is
owned, and the coordinator's cut points (acquire failure after the real domain lease committed leaves
a durable fence, restart stays blocked, guard waits out a renew fence and blocks at the parent
deadline).

Deviation from the plan's staging list: `unified/intent_store.py` is included in this commit because
the plan's own Task 2 text requires the execution generation and lease fences to live in the store's
independent tables. The plan's list omits it.

## CP-05: Task 3 - isolated safety lane

Delivered `unified/goals.py`, `unified/safety.py`, cancellation receipt types in
`unified/contracts.py` and `test/teleop/test_unified_safety.py` (registered `test_unified_safety`).

RED: 10 failed / 2 passed, exit 1 (the lane could not unpack its own shutdown sentinel and the
late-ACK fixture never prepared a child; both were fixture/implementation defects fixed forward).
GREEN: 12 passed, exit 0. Covered: delivery then stop-evidence wait, durable `cancel_requested`
before any goal is touched with later children refused, arm and gripper cancelled independently by
real UUID, duplicate cancels merged into one delivery, late ACK cancelled safely without discarding
the goal record, foreign authority refused before delivery, browser authority without an instance
refused, delivery timeout and accepted-without-stop-proof both blocking, safe queue full refusing
instead of queueing behind normal mutations, revoke without a pending authorizer refused, and
revoke linearization without a goal handle. Commit `ccb00db4`.

## CP-06: Task 4 - closed IPC and non-web child

Delivered `unified/{ipc,child_runtime,bridge,ros_child}.py`,
`test/e2e/unified_child_harness.py`, `test/e2e/noros_child_helper.py` and three test modules
(`test_unified_ipc`, `test_unified_bridge`, `test_unified_two_channel`).

IPC GREEN: 11 passed. Two-channel GREEN: 6 passed. Bridge GREEN: 7 passed. The two-channel tests run
the production `ChildRuntime` socket servers against the production `BridgeClient` over real Unix
sockets, with only the leaf `ActionDriver` test-owned; the proxy can only hold/release normal-channel
bytes and never touches the safety socket. Proven: safety revoke wins over a delayed normal packet
with `submit_count == 0`, submit wins exactly once and a repeated token never double-submits, cancel
targets the accepted UUID and keeps the reservation, expired queued mutations never dispatch,
repeated revokes do not undo the tombstone, the web-death latch cancels known pending goals and
refuses new work, and wrong epoch/token never reaches the child. Bridge tests spawn a real
ROS-free child process: fixed argv, live identity recomputation, owner-identity drift refusing to
signal, crash making the bridge unready, safety cancel over the independent socket, and a subprocess
proof that importing the web modules never loads `rclpy`.

Platform fact recorded: Darwin caps `AF_UNIX` paths at 104 bytes, so the harness allocates a short
socket scratch directory under `SO101_IPC_SOCKET_BASE` (registered root) and the child refuses an
over-long socket path explicitly.

Deviation: `unified/ros_child.py` imports the existing ROS worker lazily and its
`RclpyActionDriver.submit/cancel/terminal` intentionally fail with `ROS_DRIVER_NOT_PROVISIONED` on
this host. The socket, protocol, runtime, ownership and cancellation layers are verified; the ROS
driver wiring cannot be verified on macOS and is not claimed as working. `server.py` was not
modified in this task: the application-logic migration belongs to Task 5, and changing ROS worker
code that cannot be exercised here would be an unverifiable edit. Commit `ad1a861a`.
